            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>YOu and <hi>I</hi> having had ſome ſpeech about that place, <hi>John.</hi> 1.9. That Chriſt is the light that lighteneth every one that comes into the world: Which in the conference betwixt the King and <hi>Hubberthorne</hi> is termed <hi>your principle; viz.</hi> that every man in the world hath within himſelf a ſufficient light, (and that without Scriptures) to inſtruct and guide him in all things appertaining unto God for his ſalvation, if the fault be not in himſelf. And this you conclude from that ſaying, He is the light that lighteneth every one that comes into the world. <hi>John.</hi> 1.9. Although that <hi>Hubberthorne</hi> declared not that principle in theſe very words to the King; yet others of your way do affirme, that the light which is in every man, is of it ſelf, without Scriptures, Churches, Fatheres, Teachers, or Tutors, from Chriſtian parents, or others, a ſufficient guide to ſalvation. This aſſertion you would not deny. After thoughts upon this our Conference made me write theſe lines; which I Pray you ſeriouſly conſider.</p>
            <p>This I affirme, that Ieſus Chriſt, the ſecond perſon in the bleſſed Trinity, conſiſts of two natures; that of the Deity, &amp; that of the Humanity. The Deity is from Eternity; but ſo is not the Humanity. This place in St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes of Chriſts Deity; as he was God from all eternity, he inlighteneth every one that comes into the world. But this faith <hi>James Nayler</hi> denieth, crying out that in ſo ſaying, thou divideſt Chriſt, thereby plunging himſelf into a condemned hereſie, <hi>viz.</hi> that our Lord conſiſted not of two natures; but for ſome help to our underſtanding, you may be pleaſed to conſider that <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his third book of his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Chapter 21. ſpeaking there upon what occaſion the Foure Goſpels were written, ſaith that <hi>John</hi> preached, but writ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, till by intreaty he was moved. Now other Authors write more plainly who moved him, and upon what occaſion; namely for that <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> two Arch-heriticks did then deny and oppoſe the Deity of Jeſus Chriſt, the Biſhops in <hi>Aſia</hi> deſired St. <hi>John</hi> to write his Goſpel in oppoſition of them Hereticks: which he then did, and began his Goſpel as you ſee; <hi>In the begining was the word, and the word was God</hi> &amp;c. This in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> is very remarkable; for ſaith he, <hi>He wrote nothing till he was moved;</hi> and then omitted the Genealogie of Chriſt, amply laid down by <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> and begins his Goſpel with the Divinity of Chriſt, which is thus; <hi>In the begining was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God; and all things were made by him, and without him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was made, that was made.</hi> Marke, I pray you, how manifeſtly plain this is ſpoke of the Deity of Jeſus. Moreover St. <hi>John</hi> goes on upon the ſame Subject, ver. 4, <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</hi> Now that was the true light, St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that lighteneth every one that comes into the world, ver. 9. A like ſpeech St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>By him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>he made the worlds,</hi> ſpeaking there of more then one, namely worlds, viſible and inviſible. The meaning there is explained in another place, Coloſs. 1.17.18. <hi>By him all things were created, that are in Heaven,</hi> or <hi>that are in earth, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and inviſible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or principalities, or powers, all things were created by him, and for him, and that he was before all things, and by him all things conſiſt.</hi> This muſt be meant of the deity only; for the humanity was not then in being, till many hundreds, yea ſome thouſands of years after the Creation. Moreover Chriſt is called the wiſdome of God, 1 Cor. 1.24. and ſo he is to be with God from everlaſting, before ever the earth was laid; and when the earth was laid, <hi>then was I,</hi> ſaith that Text. I; what I? Chriſt Jeſus, termed <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. and 1 Cor 1. called <hi>the wiſdome of the Father.</hi> I was with him, as one brought up with him; and I was dayly his delight. Yea he was with him in the Creation, and by him man was made; for there was nothing made without him.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42441:3"/>He inſpired into man the breath of life, and man been me a living ſoul, <hi>Gen</hi> 2.17. This ſpirit, or breath of God, made the ſoul immortal; and in this is a Candle, or Lamp, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is called the candle of the Lord, which gives light to all our actions, and thoughts, ſearching even to the inmoſt parts of the belly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. And this is no other but the conſcience, in which is written the natural, or moral Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. which inlighteneth the conſcience; which accordingly doth now either accuſe, or excuſe, and in the Judgement day ſhall with God acquit, or condemn. And this is the light or candle of the Lord, in Scripture ſo called, that lighteneth every one that comes into the world. But this light alone, without <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, declared not, nor inſtructed men in the Ordinances, Statutes, and Judgements of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; neither doth it, without the Scriptures of the new Teſtament, the Apoſtles and Succeſſors, teach the doctrine of Chriſtianity. This light alone inſtructs not men in the doctrine, either in the Old or New Teſtament, any further then they are the ſame with the Law of nature. For the Statutes and Judgements, which by <hi>Moſes</hi> were made known to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were not ſhewed to any other Nation, but to them alone, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. ver. 20. And as for the doctrine of Chriſt, no natural light informs men of it. For who can by nature without Scriptures, Church, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Teachers, or Tutors, by Chriſtian parents, or others, come to believe in him that was Crucified at Jeruſalem, as in the true eternal Almighty God, and Saviour of the world? yea or to beleive any particular point of Chriſtian doctrine, that is not radicated and rooted in the Law of nature? The boldneſs of this aſſertion is a wonderment to men. O Lord, how doth Hereſie bewitch, and brazen mens foreheads! Doth not common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſtate them in their faces, and tell them, that let their pretence be what it will, there's not one Quaker, that could talk, conferr, or diſpute ſo as they do, but that they have been firſt tutored among Chriſtians, Scriptures, or books? yea and Chriſtians have been the <hi>Sampſons</hi> Heifers to help theſe Philiſtines. For, alas! without the help of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they could no more ſpeak of the myſteries of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, and Chriſts Goſpel, then the Philiſtians could of <hi>Sampſons</hi> Riddle, without the help of his wife.</p>
            <p>And therefore my friends, bluſh with a holy ſhame for this bold aſſertion and repent. If the doctrine, and myſteries of Chriſtian Religion could have been known without help of Scriptures, or Chriſtian Churches, or teachers, what need the Apoſtles to have been ſent forth into all the world, and that with ſo great effuſion of blood, to publiſh that which was known before, or might have been known without their help? That were to make our Lord needleſly profuſe of his ſervants blood. And what need was there, that they muſt ſtay in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> till they were endowed with power of working miracles? For without doing ſome miraculous works, the people were not bound to believe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: for ſo our Lord ſaid, <hi>If I had not done the works amongſt them, which no other man did, they had not ſinned: but now their ſin remaineth,</hi> John 15.22.24. Moreover St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect the doctrine of ſo great ſalvation?</hi> confirmed by ſo many miracles, ſignes and wonders, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3.4. And therefore doubtleſs the myſterie of Chriſtian Religion is not inſtamped in the Law of nature. For then it might have been known without ſuch a conflux of miracles, to have witneſſed it to us. <hi>How can they believe without a Preacher?</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 10.14. that is, they cannot. <hi>The natural man cannot underſtand the things that be of God.</hi> The Wiſe men of the Eaſt, notwithſtanding their great talents of natural wiſdome and knowledge, muſt come to Chriſt; the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch muſt hear <hi>Philip; Cornelius</hi> muſt ſend for <hi>Peter,</hi> without which no light was able to inform them in all things, needful to Salvation. And therefore for any to pretend to know by the light that is in every man, (and that by it alone, without any Scriptures, or books, churches, teachers, or tutors) to know every thing needful for his ſalvation, doubtleſs its a great errour, and ſuch an one as upon which many others do depend: as namely, it forceth them off from Chriſtianity, yea and to leave off all the ordinances
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42441:3"/>of Chriſts Church, both Sacraments, Lords daies, yea all daies dedicated by the Church to the ſervice of our Lord, the which Quakers now do; and indeed to center in very Gentiliſme, not obſerving in Chriſtianity any more but what the law of nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely. I do not ſay, that Chriſt cannot teach without Scriptures, Churches, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, &amp;c. For he who is God bleſſed for ever, can do all things, and with him nothing is impoſſible. He can make bread of Stones, and Fiſh of Serpents, for his children. He could cure <hi>Naaman</hi> without waſhing ſeven times in <hi>Jordan;</hi> and ſave alſo people without Scriptures, Churches, Teachers, or Sacraments; but for us to truſt, and that contrary to his revealed divine wiſdome directing, is a moſt unpardonable preſumption. And yet to theſe ſtreits do the principles of Quakers drive them upon. But this is a ſad condition, that poor deluded ſouls are in: and therefore O my friends, ſtand, pauſe, and conſider your danger. Scripture ſaith, that Hereſie proceeds from worſe to worſe. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. Hereſie is a dart, that ſtrikes through the liver; whereby the ſoule, like the poore bird, haſteth to the Snare, &amp; knoweth not that it is for her life. But her houſe, ſaith that Text, is the way to hell, going down to the Chambers of death. <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.23.27. Such deluded Souls forſake the Church, the guid of their youth, and forget the Covenant of their God. Their houſe inclineth unto death, and their pathes unto the dead. None that go unto her, returne again, neither take they hold of the pathes of life. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. Theſe paſſages the Ancient Fathers (as <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi> in his <hi>Golden rule</hi> ſaith) are principally meant of Hereticks, deluding poor ſouls: but your boldneſs ſaith, the Fathers have erred; and <hi>James Naylour,</hi> even to me, ſaid, that the ſpirit which ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God, hath revealed unto him, and many more, that which Teachers and their Churches, Parents and Tutours were all Ignorant of, though they had the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſaid he, often talked over. This is according to their principle, that the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them, and that without Scriptures, Churches, Teachers, or Chriſtian Tutours.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, This aſſertion is ſo audaciouſly bold, that it cannot be paralleld by any Hereticks. But this I pray theſe men to think upon, that their boaſting of the Spirit is the very way of the worſt of Hereticks; and if they can demonſtratively make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that their ſpirit, upon which for infallibility they ſo much boaſt of, is any better then the very worſt ſpirit of all Hereticks that ever was in the world, both I and many others will be of their Religion. But alas my Friends, I know you cannot do this; you can do nothing but condemne the Church, and Fathers, and boaſt of your parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſpirit; and ſo did all Hereticks. Conſider moreover our Lord did not make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſending the Holy Ghoſt to any particular men which were averſe from the Church, but to the Church in general, for them to decree, to bind and looſe, when they were gathered together. He ſaid, he would be with them, and that to the end of the world: and what they did on earth, the ſame he would confirme in heaven. Particular men, Sons of the Church, had his ſpirit for particular ends, profitable for people in their condition, namely to hear and obey their guides and ſuperiours. Obey thoſe whome God hath ſet over you, (ſaith the Scriptures) and ſubmit your ſelves; for they watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give account thereof. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13: 17. It is true, that in the Apoſtles daies, ſeveral members had ſeveral gifts, but ever by one and the ſame ſpirit; and that for the good of the Church. And in this kinde the ſpirits of the Prophets were ſubject to the Prophets, that ſo there might be no Schiſme in the Body, or Church. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. To this end, though St. <hi>Paul</hi> were taught his Goſpel of God, and not of man, and had an extraordinary calling from Chriſt himſelf, yet as he ſaith, he was ſent to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by revelation, to conferr the ſame Goſpel, which he had preached, with the Elders, which were the Apoſtles before him; <hi>leaſt</hi> (ſad he) <hi>I had runne or ſhould runne in vaine. Galat.</hi> 2.1.2. Behold the Humility of St. <hi>Paul!</hi> But you will ſay in <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu's</hi> words, that Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth underſtanding; and great men are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42441:4"/>not alwaies wiſe men, neither do the aged alwaies underſtand Judgement. <hi>Job.</hi> 32. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Jobs</hi> Freinds, as confident as they were of a right ſpirit, were deceived. For God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſaith, that they had not ſpoken right, as his ſervant <hi>Job</hi> had done. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid God, Take a Sacrifice, and go to my ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> and let him pray for you: for him will I accept, leaſt I deale with you after your folly. <hi>Job.</hi> 42. This is a good ſample for Sectaries, that without they be reconciled to the Church, and the Church pray for them, notwithſtanding their Confidence in the ſpirit, God will deale with them after their folly, ver. 8. And therefore my Freinds, be wiſe. Good men have been deceived, and why may not you? Be ſerious in your thoughts, for your Souls lye at the Stake. Be adviſed by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Stand in the wayes and ſee, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walke therein; and ye ſhall finde reſt to your Souls. Jerem.</hi> 6.16. This is the language of holy Scriptures. God bids <hi>Iſrael</hi> to aske of the Antient daies, that were before them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. and appointeth the Fathers to declare unto the Children, the uſe of Ancient monuments. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 4. and of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. And <hi>Gideon</hi> profeſſeth his beleife of the Miracles which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had told him. <hi>Judges.</hi> 6. and the Pſalmiſt ſaith, we have heard with our eares, O God; our Fathers have told us, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 44. and again, I have conſidred the dayes of old, and the years of Ancient times. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 77. and <hi>Moſes</hi> bids us remember the daies of old, and the years of many Generations. Aske the Fathers, ſaith he, and they ſhall ſhew thee; the Elders, and they will teach thee. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. O my Freinds, this was the way of Gods people, both in the old and new Teſtament. See an example of this in the Song of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Tell me, O thou faireſt among women, whom my ſoul loveth, where thou feedeſt. If thou knoweſt not, ſaith the Spouſe, go thy way forth by the foot-ſteps of the flocks, and feed thy kids by the Shepheards Tents. <hi>Canticles.</hi> 1.7.8. <hi>Ayaſworth</hi> cites the Rabbies expoſition of this place, who ſay, The Congregation, which is like to a fair Virgin, and whom my ſoul loveth, ſaith God, let her walk in the waies of juſt men, and order her waies by the mouth of her Governors (not by her private conception) &amp; let her lead her poſterity, &amp; learn her Children, which are like unto kids of the Goates, to go unto the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues and the Schooles. Thus ſpeak the Scriptures, and Antient Interpreters, farre differing from your way. The Apoſtle bids us, keep the cuſtoms of the Church. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. Alſo, that we hold faſt the Traditions, which we have learned, whether by word, or by Epiſtle. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.15. Alſo our Lord bids us hear the Church, and obey the Church; and he that will not, is to be accounted as a Heathen, and a Publican. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. Anſwerable is that in 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.14. If any man obey not our word, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, note that man, and have no company with him. Again, Obey thoſe, that have the rule over you: for they watch for your ſouls, and muſt give an account for them, that they may do it with joy, and not with griefe; for that is unprofitable for you. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.17. Marke that; for the greiving your Paſtours now will be grevious to you in the judgement day. But by your doctrine you acknowledge not for your ſouls neither rulers, teachers, nor guids, but only the light within you, for which you alledge <hi>Jſa.</hi> 30.20. Thy teachers ſhall not be removed into a corner any more, but thy eyes ſhall ſee thy Teachers. But according to your doctrine, this light, <hi>viz.</hi> your teacher in every man, leſs or more, was never in any other corner, then where he is now. Beſides all this, the old Teſtament ſheweth that if any controverſies did ariſe, for reſolution the Jewes were to go to the Preiſts of the Levitical tribe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. but according to your doctrine neither they nor you ought to go either to ruler, Preiſt, or teacher; for thats within you; a light that lighteneth every man borne of a woman: which light was never in any other corner, then in that which it is in now.</p>
            <p>O my Freinds, we count many of you honeſt men and rational men, and wonder at your Stupid ſenſeleſneſs. O Lord, what hath bewitched you? Some foregoing ſins cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42441:4"/>hath provoked the Almighty, ſo that he hath permitted an evill ſpirit to delude you. Conſider your by-paſt lives with trembling, Many of your leaders, before they were Quakers, were in Armes againſt the King and the Church, thereby to get a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſerve God without trouble in the Fleſh; and by conſequence to make void the Croſs of Chriſt. O this was a deadly Sin; you fought againſt your Soveraign to gain a liberty to the fleſh. Alſo many of you have renounced the Baptiſme, that you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the name of the Bleſſed Trinity into the ſaith of Chriſts Church. O, this was a deadly Sin; by which in a manner you did put your ſelves out of Gods Protection, and ſo became active Inſtruments to the Devill, for rebellion, or hereſy. I do not ſay all have thus done, but I ſayſome; and perhaps others by a looſe and evill life, made ſome gradual Stepts into, or towards this way.</p>
            <p>But you will object, and I have heard it objected, that you are now become what you now be, of better lives then ever you were before. O my Freinds, let not a good life in Schiſme or hereſie delude you; for by the ſeeming good lives of Hereticks the Devil hath ever promoted his Kingdome. So <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices were of ſeeming good lives, and notable Oratours; for which they compared themſelves with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Numbers</hi> the 16. The Iſraelites thought ſo alſo, crying out againſt <hi>Moſes;</hi> ye have ſlain the Lords people, ſaid they, verſe 14. And truly, as it was then, ſo it ever was, that the Schiſmaticks that pretend to reforme their mother-Church, generally they ſeem to be of better lives, then the Church was of: for if this were not ſo, they could have deluded very few. But ſo it ever happens; Miniſters of Satan transforme themſelves into the habits of Angels of light, to deceive. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13.14.15. And therefore let not this gloſs keep you in ſnares, but deliver thy ſoul as a Roe from the hand of the Hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the Fowler, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.5. you that are oppoſers of Gods Church, if poſſible, recover your ſelves out of the Snare of the Devil, who as yet by him are led Captive at his will. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. Which that you may, ſhall be the earneſt prayer of your faithfull Freind,</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> 
               <hi>What eſteem do you beare to the Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> We account of them the very beſt of all writings, and as they iſſue forth from their Original Authors, they then were the pure wine of God; but as they have paſſed through the hands of many Copies, and ſince them again of many Tranſlators and Printers, theſe Scriptures have in length of time paſſing through the Antichriſtian chanel, contracted ſome Ruſt, and are now helped by the Spirit in the ſaints, which is no other but the ſame ſpirit, by which at firſt thoſe Scriptures were declared to the world.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> 
               <hi>But for that they were declared to ſeveral people, and that upon ſeveral ocaſions, of what uſe are they now of to another people, and that alſo in another generation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>A</label> Of great uſe, if applied by the ſame ſpirit to others to the ſame end for which at firſt they were given forth, then are they profitable for doctrin, reproof, correction &amp; Inſtruction. <hi>2 Tim. 3.16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> 
               <hi>But are they not alſo profitable to himſelf that hath the ſpirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> Not for theſe ends; for he needeth them not, be having the unction that teacheth him all things. <hi>1 Joh. 2.20.</hi> Yea the deepe things of God, <hi>1. Cor 2.10.</hi> And needeth not that any man teach him; for he hath the Anointing faith, that text that teacheth him all things, <hi>1. Joh. 2.27.</hi> ſo that for a particular mans ſalvation that hath the Anointing, the written Scriptures profit him nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> 
               <hi>Why then do they preach by Scriptures or in Scriptures phraſes? this argueth that ye need the help of Scriptures to preach by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> It is for the ſake of others who ſo highly eſteeme of Scriptures we are forced to uſe that they ſo highly eſteem, to convince them by; and moreover in this we ſeem weak with the weak that we might ſave ſome, <hi>1. Cor. 9.</hi> and in this kind did <hi>Humphry Woulridg</hi> as he ſaid condeſend to rebaptiſe a woman, not that he regarded baptiſme, but that the woman had a minde to be dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, he condeſcended to her weakneſs, that thereby he might bring her out of the water unto the Rock; this be mentioneth in his book which he Intitleth, <hi>The unlimited God.</hi>

               <p>This is the very anſwer that <hi>Joſiah Carbrane</hi> the pretended prophet to <hi>John Roberts</hi> who made himſelf God; he that writes heard him ſpeak it, that they uſed not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for their own ſakes, but for the ſakes of others, and moreover that they would deale with any men even with their own weapons, <hi>viz.</hi> Scriptures; ſo he ſpake there were ſix or ſeven that fell down before Juſtice <hi>Hubberts.</hi> Face &amp; worſhipped this <hi>Roberts</hi> for a God, as the woman worſhipped <hi>Naylor</hi> for a Chriſt; but as <hi>Naylor</hi> was worſhipped and Pillered for his blaſphemy; ſo was <hi>Roberts</hi> and his worſhippers ſent by Juſtice <hi>Hubbert</hi> to the priſon in S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Joane's.</hi> But why was it ſaid the woman worſhipped <hi>James Naylor</hi> for a Chriſt, and <hi>Roberts</hi> by his followers was worſhipped for a God? why not the Chriſt and the God, but a Chriſt and a God?</p>
               <p>Anſ. James Naylors <hi>anſwer was that in whomſoever the light</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſt is eminent. the ſame is a Chriſt or Saviour;</hi> Obadiah <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Saviours ſhall come on mount</hi> Sion <hi>to judge the mount of</hi> Eſau, <hi>and in the ſame ſence would</hi> Roberts <hi>prove himſelf a God. Thus we ſee how horribly the Scriptures are abuſed.</hi>
